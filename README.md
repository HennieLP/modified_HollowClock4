# modified_HollowClock4

Thanks to shiura for this awesome project!

This is the Hollow Clock 4 by shiura, but implemented with an ESP8266 D1 which can get the real time from an NTP server.

The CAD files and the original version can be found here:

Just follow the instructions on Instructables and in the Code to make it work.
